      <article id="about">
        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>After graduating high school, I became a salesman at a local automotive tuning shop. While there, I took up welding in
        my spare time. Later, I worked as a manufacturing welder, and then an assembly mechanic. All the while, I held my love of sim-racing.</p>

        <p>The very first time I encountered code was in the sim-racing title <em>Assetto Corsa</em>. To modify an in-game car's physics characteristics, it may be required to edit
        game files using a text editor. The first time I did so, I had no clue that I was coding! However, I had found my calling.</p>

        <p>In March 2022, I began my journey to becoming a software engineer with <a href="https://www.py4e.com/" target="\_blank">Python4Everybody</a>. Now, I continue on my
        journey as a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="\_blank">Thinkful</a>.</p>

        <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer, please <a href="#contact">Contact Me!</a>. I like to collaborate with
        other engineers and deliver great quality work.</p>
